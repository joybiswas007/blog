# Blog Dashboard
Easily manage your blog.

> Note: I'm not very good at frontend (and honestly, super lazy to learn it).
This is the best design I could come up with (with the help of AI).
If anyone wants to help improve the dashboard, that would be really awesome!

## Known Issues
+ After logging in, the dashboard doesn't redirect to /. You have to manually refresh the page to see the logged-in state.
+ Authentication flow might need some improvements and cleanup.
+ And some other fixes
+ Also fix the readme after cleanup :xD
